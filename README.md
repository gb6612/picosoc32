# picosoc32
32 bits RISC-V architecture based on the [picorv32](https://github.com/YosysHQ/picorv32)

Included qFlow for RTL to GDS implementation   
2300x2550um area, using OSU018 technology PDK. Note that OSU018 has a very limited number of std cells (<20). By using a more complete PDK (100+ std cells), this area is further reduced.
